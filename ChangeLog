- Improved performance of ResultSetMetaData methods getPrecision(),
  getScale(), isNullable() and isAutoIncrement(). The data is fetched
  from the server by sending a query. This used to be one query for
  each column of the ResultSet. Now these metadata queries are combined
  into one query fetching this meta data for up to 50 columns in one query.
  This reduces the number of queries sent to the server significantly.
  This is noticable for instance when using generic JDBC query tools
  such as SQuirreL, which now respond much faster.

- Implemented fix for released monetdb-jdbc-3.0.jre8.jar and
  monetdb-mcl-1.19.jre8.jar when it is was run using java build 1.8.0_###.
  It would throw:
  java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.nio.CharBuffer.mark()Ljava/nio/CharBuffer;
  at org.monetdb.mcl.parser.StartOfHeaderParser.getNextAsString(Unknown Source)
  at org.monetdb.jdbc.MonetConnection$ResponseList.executeQuery(Unknown Source)
  at org.monetdb.jdbc.MonetConnection$ResponseList.processQuery(Unknown Source)
  at org.monetdb.jdbc.MonetStatement.internalExecute(Unknown Source)
  at org.monetdb.jdbc.MonetStatement.execute(Unknown Source)
  The problem is caused by a change in java.nio.CharBuffer API (return
  types of methods mark() and reset() have changed from Buffer to
  CharBuffer) from Java 8 to Java 9+.
