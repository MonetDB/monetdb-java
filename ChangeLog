# ChangeLog file for monetdb-java
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Thu Jan 27 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Compiled and released new jar files: monetdb-jdbc-3.2.jre8.jar,
  monetdb-mcl-1.21.jre8.jar and jdbcclient.jre8.jar

* Wed Jan 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Fixed an SQL query problem in DatabaseMetaData.getBestRowIdentifier()
  method when used with MonetDB Jan2022 (or newer) releases. It
  returned java.sql.SQLException:
   SELECT: with DISTINCT ORDER BY expressions must appear in select list
  As of MonetDB Jan2022 (11.43.5) such queries are no longer allowed.
  The internally used SQL query has been improved.

* Thu Jan 13 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Extended JdbcClient application with support for following \d commands:
    \dt  \dv  \dSt  \dSv  \df  \dp  \dSf  \dSp  \dn  \dSn  and  \ds
  for showing list of: user tables, user views, system tables, system views,
  user functions, user procedures, system functions, system procedures,
  user schemas, system schemas and user sequences.
  For more information, see the built-in help (\?) on available commands.

* Thu Nov 25 2021 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Extended FileTransferHandler utility class by adding support for reading from
  and writing to gzip compressed files when using file name extension .gz
  Also improve error handling by testing on empty file name and provide more
  information when invalid file name is given or other compression formats are
  requested. As the FileTransferHandler utility class is used by JdbcClient
  application, it will now also support this functionality.

* Fri Nov 05 2021 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- The JdbcClient application has been extended to support the new
    COPY ... ON CLIENT functionality.
  However for security reasons you must provide an explicit new startup argument
    --csvdir "/absolute/path/to/csvdatafiles"
  or on MS Windows
    --csvdir "C:\\path\\to\\csvdatafiles"
  in order to activate the JdbcClient application to down/up load data to/from
  the local file system.

* Fri Nov 05 2021 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Extended the MonetDB JDBC driver with support for the ON CLIENT clause of
  the COPY statements. To make use of this functionality you must first
  register handlers for upload and download of data.
  The MonetConnection class has been extended with 2 methods:
    public void setUploadHandler(UploadHandler uploadHandler)
    public void setDownloadHandler(DownloadHandler downloadHandler)
  The MonetDB JDBC driver API has been extended with interfaces:
    public interface org.monetdb.jdbc.MonetConnection.UploadHandler
    public interface org.monetdb.jdbc.MonetConnection.DownloadHandler
  See onclient.txt for more information on how to use these from Java.
  We also provide a utility class:
    public class org.monetdb.util.FileTransferHandler
  which provides an example implementation of the MonetConnection.UploadHandler
  and MonetConnection.DownloadHandler interfaces useable for reading files
  from or writing files to a local file system.
