# ChangeLog file for monetdb-java
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Thu Oct 2 2025 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Compiled and released new jar files: monetdb-jdbc-12.1.jre8.jar and
  jdbcclient.jre8.jar

* Thu Sep 18 2025 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added support for new MonetDB data types: inet4 and inet6.

* Tue Sep  9 2025 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Fixed the 'debug' and 'logfile' properties. The log file was opened
  but immediately closed again.
- Made the log file name choosing algorithm more robust against race
  conditions: instead of checking whether the intended file already exists
  and opening it when it doesn't, open it in 'create' mode and handle
  the error that gets thrown when it already exists.
- conn.getMetaData().supportsTransactionIsolationLevel() now always
  returns 'true' exept for level TRANSACTION_NONE. It used to return 'true'
  only for TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE, but serializable actually implies
  the other levels. Matches the behavior of PostgreSQL.

* Mon Sep  1 2025 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Automatic compression and decompression in FileTransferHandler can now
  be disabled by passing 'false' as the third constructor parameter.

* Thu Jul  3 2025 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Corrected output of columns SEARCHABLE and AUTO_INCREMENT of method
  DatabaseMetaData.getTypeInfo(). Most types are searchable with LIKE
  pattern matching. AUTO_INCREMENT is no longer true for base integer types.

* Fri Apr  4 2025 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Improve error message when server closes the connection immediately after
  accepting it.

* Wed Mar 31 2025 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Fixed more result set leaks.

* Wed Feb 26 2025 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Properties 'clientkey' and 'clientcert' are no longer included in the
  result of Driver#getPropertyInfo() because though the driver recognizes
  them, it does not support them.
- Fixed a number of result set leak when Statement#setMaxRows was called.

* Thu Feb 13 2025 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Corrected the returned integer values of Statement methods
  getUpdateCount() and getLargeUpdateCount(). They returned -2 for
  DDL statements, which was not in compliance with the JDBC API
  documentation. Now they no longer return numbers smaller than -1.
- Corrected the returned integer values of Statement methods
  executeUpdate(...) and executeLargeUpdate(...) and PreparedStatement
  methods executeUpdate() and executeLargeUpdate(). They returned -2 for
  DDL statements, which was not in compliance with the JDBC API
  documentation. Now they no longer return negative numbers.

* Wed Feb 12 2025 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Fix a bug in DatabaseMetaData.getTables() where a provided string in the
  array of table types argument would contain a single quote or back slash.
  It was not escaped properly, resulting in an SQL syntax error.
- Fix missing escaping of single back slashes in string data provided to
  PreparedStatement methods setString(), setClob(), setObject() and setURL().
