/**
 * This simple example somewhat emulates the mclient command. However in
 * it's simpleness it only supports SQL queries which entirely are on one line.
 *
 * This program reads a file line by line, and feeds the line into a running
 * Mserver5 on the localhost. Upon error, the error is reported and the program
 * continues reading and executing lines.
 * A very lousy way of implementing options is used to somewhat configure the
 * behaviour of the program in order to be a bit more verbose or commit after
 * each (successfully) executed line.
 *
 * The program uses a debuglog in which the exact conversation between the
 * JDBC driver and Mserver is reported. The log file is put in the current
 * working directory and names like monet_[unix timestamp].log
