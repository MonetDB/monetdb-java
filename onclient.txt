ON CLIENT support

MonetDB provides the nonstandard COPY INTO statement to perform bulk inserts and
retrievals, see also
https://www.monetdb.org/Documentation/ServerAdministration/LoadingBulkData.

By default, COPY INTO accesses files on the server but it also has a mode to
access files on the client.  This is supported by the command line tool
mclient(1) and now also as an extension to the MonetDB JDBC driver.

This is how it works: The JDBC client automatically announces that it is capable
of file transfers.  If you execute, for example,

	COPY INTO mytable FROM 'data.csv' ON CLIENT;

the server will send a request for file 'data.csv' to the JDBC driver.
By default, the JDBC driver will refuse with an error message:

	'No file upload handler has been registered with the JDBC driver'.

This is for security reasons.  However, you can register a callback to handle
these requests from the server:

	Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl, userName, password);
	MyUploader handler = new MyUploadHandler();
	conn.unwrap(MonetConnection.class).setUploadHandler(handler);

Here, MyUploadHandler is an implementation of the interface MonetConnection.UploadHandler,
whose main component is the method

	/**
	 * Called if the server sends a request to write a file.
	 *
	 * Use the given handle to receive data or send errors to the server.
	 *
	 * @param handle Handle to communicate with the server
	 * @param name Name of the file the server would like to read. Make sure to
	 *             validate this before reading from the file system
	 * @param textMode Whether this is text or binary data.
	 */
	void handleUpload(MonetConnection.Upload handle, String name, boolean textMode, int offset)
			throws IOException;

In your implementation of this method, you can use the 'handle' object to
communicate with the server, for example:

- PrintStream getStream() to obtain a stream object to which you can write.
  This is useful if you want to generate the data on the fly.

- void uploadFrom(InputStream stream) to have the JDBC driver read data from the
  stream and send it to the server as-is.  For text mode uploads this means the
  text must be UTF-8 encoded.

- void uploadFrom(Reader reader) to have the JDBC driver read text from the given
  Reader and upload it.

- void uploadFrom(BufferedReader reader, int offset) to have the JDBC driver read from
  the given BufferedReader, and upload the text starting at line 'offset'. Typically
  you would use the offset passed to handleUpload in parameter 'offset'.

- void sendError(String errorMessage) to refuse the upload.

If you use sendError to refuse the upload, the COPY INTO statement will fail but
the connection will remain usable. On the other hand, if you implementation of
handleUpload throws an IO Exception, the connection will be closed because there
is no way to signal errors to the server once the transfer has begun.

The interface for downloading is similar to that for uploading.

Class org.monetdb.util.FileTransferHandler provides a default implementation of
both MonetConnection.UploadHandler and MonetConnection.DownloadHandler.  You
pass it a directory name and a flag indicating whether the contents of that
directory can be assumed to be UTF-8 encoded. It is intended for situations
where  you do not need to generate or transform data while uploading.
