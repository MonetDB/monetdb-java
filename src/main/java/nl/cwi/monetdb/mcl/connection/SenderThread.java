/**
 * A thread to send a query to the server.  When sending large amounts of data to a server, the output buffer of the
 * underlying communication socket may overflow.  In such case the sending process blocks. In order to prevent deadlock,
 * it might be desirable that the driver as a whole does not block. This thread facilitates the prevention of such
 * 'full block', because this separate thread only will block.<br /> This thread is designed for reuse, as thread
 * creation costs are high.
