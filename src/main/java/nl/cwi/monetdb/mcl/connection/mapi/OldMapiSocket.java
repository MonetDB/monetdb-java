/**
 * A Socket for communicating with the MonetDB database in MAPI block mode. The OldMapiSocket implements the protocol
 * specifics of the MAPI block mode protocol,
 *
 * For each line read, it is determined what type of line it is according to the MonetDB MAPI protocol version 9. This
 * results in a line to be PROMPT, HEADER, RESULT, ERROR or UNKNOWN.
 *
 * The general use of this Socket must be seen only in the full context of a MAPI connection to a server. It has the
 * same ingredients as a normal Socket, allowing for seamless plugging.
 * <pre>
 *    Socket   \     /  InputStream  ----&gt;
 *              &gt; o &lt;
 *  MapiSocket /     \ OutputStream  ----&gt;
 * </pre>
 * The OldMapiSocket allows to retrieve Streams for communicating.  They are interfaced, so they can be chained in any
 * way.  While the Socket transparently deals with how data is sent over the wire, the actual data read needs to be
 * interpreted, for which a Reader/Writer interface is most sufficient.
