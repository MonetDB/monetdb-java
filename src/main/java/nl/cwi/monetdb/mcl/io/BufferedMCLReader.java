/**
 * Read text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as
 * to provide a means for efficient reading of characters, arrays and
 * lines.  This class is based on the BufferedReader class, and provides
 * extra functionality useful for MCL.
 *
 * The BufferedMCLReader is typically used as layer inbetween an
 * InputStream and a specific interpreter of the data.
 * <pre>
 *                         / Response
 * BufferedMCLReader ---o &lt;- Tuple
 *                         \ DataBlock
 * </pre>
 * Because the BufferedMCLReader provides an efficient way to access the
 * data from the stream in a linewise fashion, whereby each line is
 * identified as a certain type, consumers can easily decide how to
 * parse each retrieved line.  The line parsers from
 * nl.cwi.monetdb.mcl.parser are well suited to work with the lines
 * outputted by the BufferedMCLReader.
 * This class is client-oriented, as it doesn't take into account the
 * messages as the server receives them.
