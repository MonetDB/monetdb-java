/**
 * Write text to a character-output stream, buffering characters so as
 * to provide a means for efficient writing of single characters,
 * arrays, and strings.
 *
 * In contrast to the BufferedWriter class, this class' newLine()
 * method always writes the newline character '\n', regardless the
 * platform's own notion of line separator.  Apart from that there are
 * no differences in the behaviour of this class, compared to its parent
 * class, the BufferedWriter.  A small convenience is built into this
 * class for cooperation with the BufferedMCLReader, via the
 * registerReader() method.  It causes the reader to be reset upon each
 * write performed though this class.  This effectuates the MCL protocol
 * flow where a write invalidates the state of the read buffers, since
 * each write must be answered by the server.  That also makes this
 * class client-oriented when a reader is registered.
