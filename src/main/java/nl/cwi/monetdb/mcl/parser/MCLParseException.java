 * MCLParseException as soon as something that is read cannot be
 * understood or does not conform to the specifications (e.g. a
 * missing field).  The instance that throws the exception will try to
 * give an error offset whenever possible.  Alternatively it makes sure
 * that the error message includes the offending data read.
