/**
 * When an ProtocolException is thrown, the underlying protocol is violated by the sender. In general a stream reader
 * throws an ProtocolException as soon as something that is read cannot be understood or does not conform to the
 * specifications (e.g. a missing field). The instance that throws the exception will try to give an error offset
 * whenever possible. Alternatively it makes sure that the error message includes the offending data read.
