 * A Wrapper class which provide the ability to retrieve the delegate instance
 * when the instance in question is in fact a proxy class.
 *
 * The wrapper pattern is employed by many JDBC driver implementations to provide
 * extensions beyond the traditional JDBC API that are specific to a data source.
 * Developers may wish to gain access to these resources that are wrapped (the delegates)
 * as proxy class instances representing the the actual resources.
 * This class contains a standard mechanism to access these wrapped resources
 * represented by their proxy, to permit direct access to the resource delegates.
