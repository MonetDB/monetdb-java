/**
 * Interface for parsers in MCL.  The parser family in MCL is set up as
 * a reusable object.  This allows the same parser to be used again for
 * the same type of work.  While this is a very unnatural solution in
 * the Java language, it prevents many object creations on a low level
 * of the protocol.  This favours performance.
 *
 * A typical parser has a method parse() which takes a String, and the
 * methods hasNext() and next() to retrieve the values that were
 * extracted by the parser.  Parser specific methods may be available to
 * perform common tasks.
